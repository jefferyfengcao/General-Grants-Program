# Substrate RPC module for web3 compatibility

## Project Description
EVM is important in Substrate framework. With EVM, Substrate can be easily compatible with Ethereum ecosystem. Existing module provide the EVM module itself and a lot relevent should be done to fully support EVM in Substrate, specifically to provide rpc proxy with web3 compatability.
This project intents to develop a Substrate RPC module for web3 compatibility.

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1 — Implement Hello World Smart Constract with pallet-evm in Substrate — 2.5 month 
* We will setup dev environment，code analytics on substrate，and debug solidity bin-code with pallet-evm.
* We will deliver an integrated pallet-evm in substrate enviroment with an runable hello world smart contract in solidity.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with the substrate enviroment, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 2 — Implement storage of additional indexing of data with db in Substrate — 2.5 month
* We will create a storage layer to store the additional indexing of data into DB including Transactions-by-hash，Receipts
and Logs.
* We will deliver the storage layer with all required functions to store indexing of data into DB.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with our substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 3 — Implement RPC proxy or Substrate RPC extension for web3 compatibility — 2 month
* We will develop a separate binary (RPC proxy), or built as Substrate RPC extension. We will determine that after Milestone 1.
 We will take Substrate’s state root as the returned blocks state root.
* We will deliver the RPC proxy and their implatation to enable the end user to access Substrate in web3 compatibilible way.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

## Future Plans
* We will build parachain to connect Sustrate with PCHAIN.
