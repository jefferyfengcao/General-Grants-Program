# To Support EVM Full Function in Substrate

## Project Description
EVM is important in Substrate framework. With EVM, Substrate can be easily compatible with Ethereum ecosystem. Existing module provide the EVM module itself and a lot relevent should be done to fully support EVM in Substrate for example to store smart contract in db and 
to provide rpc for deploy smart contract. This project intents to support EVM full function in sustrate with above functions.

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1 — Implement Hello World Smart Constract with pallet-evm in Substrate — 2.5 month 
* We will setup dev environment，code analytics on substrate，and debug solidity bin-code with pallet-evm.
* We will deliver an integrated pallet-evm in substrate enviroment with an runable hello world smart contract in solidity.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with the substrate enviroment, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 2 — Implement storage of solidity smart contract with db in Substrate — 2,5 month
* We will create a storage layer to store the solidity smart contract into DB.
* We will deliver the storage layer with all required functions to store the solidity smart contract into DB.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with our substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 3 — Implement rpc for deploying smart contract — 2 month
* We will create a group of rpc for deploying smart contract.
* We will deliver the rpc interfaces and their implatation to enable the end user to deploy smart contract.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

## Future Plans
* We will build parachain to connect Sustrate with PCHAIN.
